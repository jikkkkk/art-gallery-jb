# art-gallery-jb
This project is a C++ software application that allows users to create and manage objects from an art gallery, such as paintings, sculptures, and other artwork types. It was designed to demonstrate a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, aggregation, objects, classes, attributes, and constructors.
